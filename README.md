# Generative-Experiments

## TO DO
* Time Discriminator update for isolated random batch
    * Why is it so slow? Gradients? Optimizer update?
* Convolutional Generator and Discriminator
* WGAN - https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.07875
* Traversing z-space images clip
* Conditional GAN for MNIST images with single model; single G and single D for multiple classes
