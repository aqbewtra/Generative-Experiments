# Generative-Experiments

## TO DO
* Discriminator loss approaches 0, causing vanishing gradients and the generator training to collapse. How to prevent vanishing gradients?
* Logits? Or not Logits?
* Measure time discriminator updates for isolated random batch. The discriminator runs really slow. Why? Gradients? Optimizer update?
* Convolutional Generator and Discriminator
* WGAN - https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.07875
* Traversing z-space images clip
* Conditional GAN for MNIST images with single model; single G and single D for multiple classes
